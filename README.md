READ ME

The motivation for this project is to help promote a business called Horiseon Social Solution Services
and incorporate many accessibility elements to provide inclusivity to a variety of customers.

I built this project to build the accessibility to existing code and organize semantics to a
reader friendly code.

This project promotes the company Horiseon Social Solution Services and promotes the use of 
accessibilty elements.

I learned about different elements in images such as alt:"" and title:"" as well as debugging and testing 
of existing code for click-able links and items.
